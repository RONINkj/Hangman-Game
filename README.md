This project was a fun and rewarding experience, allowing me to combine my programming skills with some creative ASCII art. Here's what I focused on:
Developing the game logic in Python
Incorporating engaging ASCII art to enhance the user experience
Ensuring the game is both challenging and enjoyable
🗝️ Key Features:
- Fun and interactive Hangman game
- Integrated ASCII art for a visually engaging experience
- User-friendly input and feedback system
🎯 Why This Matters:
- Enhances problem-solving skills
- Demonstrates creativity in coding
- Engages users in a classic game with a modern twist
🔍 How It Works:
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list
- Prompts user to guess letters
- Updates the display with correct guesses and reduces lives for incorrect ones
🔧 Technical Details:
- Utilizes Python’s random module for word selection
- Implements game logic with loops and conditionals
- Features modular design with separate files for word list and ASCII art
